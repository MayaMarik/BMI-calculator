# BMI-calculator
 This Python script calculates your Body Mass Index (BMI) based on your weight in kilograms and height in meters. It then categorizes the BMI into underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese categories. In this project I used the input() function and conditional statements (if, elif, else).
